Backend Implementation First:
Data Structure and Logic: Design the database schemas (Village, User) and set up the logic to handle CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for villages and users.*********
API Endpoints: Create API routes and controllers to handle requests for creating villages, managing users, retrieving data, etc.*************
Authentication and Authorization: Implement user authentication, ensuring secure access to user data and functionalities.*************
Testing: Conduct backend testing to verify that the data operations, authentication, and endpoints work correctly.*************
Once your backend is in place and functioning well, you can move on to the frontend: (THERE ARE PROBLEMS IN TESTINGS)

Frontend Implementation Next:
UI Components: Develop the UI components for displaying villages, user profiles, search functionalities, etc.*************
API Integration: Connect frontend components with backend APIs, enabling data retrieval, user interactions, and displaying information.*************
User Authentication: Implement frontend login/signup forms, user profiles, and manage user sessions.*************
Testing: Perform frontend testing to ensure the UI components work as expected and integrate well with the backend.
