Here are the key parts of a web application:

1. Frontend (Client-Side):
User Interface (UI): The visual part of the application that users interact with. It includes design elements, layout, and navigation.
HTML, CSS, JavaScript: HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) structures the content, CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) styles the presentation, and JavaScript provides interactivity and dynamic behavior.
2. Backend (Server-Side):
Server: Hardware or software that provides functionality, services, or resources to other programs or devices (often includes databases, files, etc.).
Application Logic: This part manages the application's functionality, processes user requests, and interacts with databases.
Database: Stores and manages the application's data. Common types include SQL databases (like MySQL, PostgreSQL) or NoSQL databases (like MongoDB).
3. Communication:
HTTP/HTTPS Protocol: Hypertext Transfer Protocol (Secure) is the foundation for communication between a client (web browser) and a server.
APIs (Application Programming Interfaces): Enable different software systems to communicate and interact with each other.
4. Infrastructure and Deployment:
Web Servers: Software responsible for serving web content to users. Examples include Apache, Nginx.
Hosting: Services that provide infrastructure for hosting web applications. For instance, AWS, Azure, or various cloud hosting providers.
Deployment Tools: Tools and practices used to deploy the application code to servers or cloud services.
5. Security:
Authentication and Authorization: Managing user access to specific resources or functionalities.
Encryption: Protecting sensitive data transmitted between the client and server using protocols like SSL/TLS.
Input Validation and Sanitization: Ensuring data entered by users is safe and free from potential malicious content (SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.).
6. Testing and Monitoring:
Unit Testing, Integration Testing: Ensuring individual parts and the system as a whole work correctly.
Logging and Monitoring Tools: Tracking errors, performance, and usage of the application for debugging and optimization.
7. Version Control and Collaboration:
Version Control Systems (e.g., Git): Managing changes to source code, facilitating collaboration among developers, and maintaining different versions.
